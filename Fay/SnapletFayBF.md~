    Could not deduce (Data f2) arising from a use of ‘showToFay’
    from the context (Show f2)
      bound by the type signature for
                 toFayax :: Show f2 => Handler h1 h2 f2 -> Handler h1 h2 ()
      at src/Snap/Snaplet/Fay.hs:123:12-58
    Possible fix:
      add (Data f2) to the context of
        the type signature for
          toFayax :: Show f2 => Handler h1 h2 f2 -> Handler h1 h2 ()
    In the second argument of ‘(.)’, namely ‘showToFay’
    In the second argument of ‘(.)’, namely ‘A.encode . showToFay’
    In the first argument of ‘(=<<)’, namely
      ‘writeLBS . A.encode . showToFay’
