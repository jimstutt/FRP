The conservation form

>  dA + AA == 0

is equivalent to the soliton equation:

A guage transformation with an invertible function phi is:

>-- data A 
>--   | a' a = phi * a * unphi - Df phi unphi 

This induces the transformation:

>-- F' = phi * F * unphi

of the 2-curvature. Holds for any G-connection where G is a matrix group and phi has values.

Simply (ha) deform the differential calculus (DC) by applying the zero-curvature condition to the Cole-Hopf transformation to produce a pure guage. Help.

Burgers, KdV, Kadomshev-Padiashvilli (KP) and  Boussinquet equations can be expressed as a zero-curvature condition for a GL(1,R)-connection wrt. a *non-commutative* calculus; an analogue of a differential calculus of forms where 1-forms and functions in general do not commute.

In ordinary differential calculus the product of a 1-form with itself vanishes?
This means that non-trivial relations emerge even from F = 0 for a single 1-form (and not just a matrix of 1-forms).

a) create a necessary part of the software infrastructure, including the implementation of numerical algorithms, that are needed for the Navier-Stokes equations,

b) gain some insights into spectral methods, like: How do I handle millions of coupled ordinary differential equations? What happens when the solution develops singular behaviour like shock waves?

Of course we won't need millions of ODE to get a good approximation, I think, but you get millions of coupled ODE when you use spectral methods for the globe, if you'd like to get a decent approximation of the synoptic scale.

I'm sorry but I don't think there is anything of interest for a pure mathematician here.

First, we start with a connection 1-form  written in terms of right components, i.e.



Burgers equation is a zero curvature condition, so we need to compute the curvature of this connection given by



The first step is easy. we simply need to compute the exterior derivative



In this step, we used the fact that



and



Next we compute



The basis  commutes with 0-forms and  so the first term above vanishes. The third term can be rewritten



so we have



The goal is to now move all basis 1-forms to the left of all 0-forms (something like normal ordering). To do this, we can start by writing the product rule as



and expanding so that



Carrying out all the differentiations results in



Returning to  we can now write



or simply



We can now write down the curvature



This vanishes when



which, aside from the term involving , is Burgers equation (with correct signs).

Having corrected the connection 1-form by writing the 0-form components to the right of the basis 1-forms, it is a simple matter to extend this analysis to higher dimensions. When extending to (3+1)-dimensions, we get the Navier-Stokes equation where the meaning of becomes clear. See the post

Navier-Stokes from the zero curvature condition in noncommutative geometry
where it becomes obvious that  is the negative of the pressure, so Burgers equation can be expressed with a pressure term as



I don't know about you, but this boggles my mind.

Of course the next step will be to correct the discrete Burgers equation and finally to write down the discrete Navier-Stokes equation (with maybe a detour or two along the way).


-- | Cole-Hopf

I wanted to work out the Cole-Hopf transformation using the correct form of Burgers equation. It turned out to be a little tricky (not too bad) so I'll leave this note.

The Cole-Hopf transformation comes about simply by expressing the connection 1-form



as a pure gauge connection, i.e.



It is just a little tricky because we have a  on the left side of the differential  and we want to compare to the original connection written in right-component form with all 0-forms to the right of the basis 1-forms.

The most straightforward way I found is to observe that



so the pure gauge connection can be written in two equivalent ways



where . Expanding this, we have



so that

Cole-Hopf Transformation

-- | Eric Forgy Discrete Calculus



 a discrete left martingale with zero curvature as the discrete Burgers equation.

Since the discrete calculus used to derive the discrete Burgers equation converges to the continuum calculus used to derive the continuum Burgers equation, then any solution to the discrete Burgers equation is guaranteed to converge to a solution of the continuum Burgers equation by construction.

Now that we know what the discrete Burgers equation is, it is now just a matter of turning the crank to determine the corresponding numerical algorithm.
